# Battleship - JS Edition
The game of Battleship, written in JS.

## Requirements
nodejs

## User Instructions
To start the program, run *Battleship.js* using *nodejs*.  From there, the game will prompt you to place your ships onto the grid, starting with the carrier.

Once your ships have been placed, the computer will place its ships onto its grid.  Your objective is to sink the computer's ships before it can sink yours.

## Other Notes
The computer uses a very simple targeting algorithm (pick a random coordinate and shoot), so you'll likely win.
